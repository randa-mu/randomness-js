## @randamu/randomness-js

A convenience library for retrieving, verifying and deriving randomness from the dcrypt network.

Build everything by running `npm run build`. This creates an `index.js` and `index.d.ts` at the root directory.

Solidity interfaces for randomenss can be found in the [randomness-solidity](./randomness-solidity) directory.
